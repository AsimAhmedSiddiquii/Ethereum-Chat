# Ethereum Chat

### What is EthChat?
EthChat is a secure distributed chat client running on the Ethereum blockchain. EthChat leverages Smart Contracts to create a chat application without a central server. Messages sent to the blockchain cannot be modified or faked, ensuring complete security.

### What technologies does EthChat use?
The EthChat smart contract is built using Solidity. This contract is currently running on the Ethereum blockhain and functions as the backend. The frontend is written using AngularJS, jQuery, Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

### Installation Instructions
To run EthChat yourself, host the static web files and navigate to the index. If you want to try hosting EthChat on your localhost, you can use https://github.com/indexzero/http-server to test it out. EthChat requires that MetaMask is installed in order to query the blockchain.
